## CORE PURPOSE & POSITIONING

**Mission:** Build a brighter world for future generations through novel applications of machine learning and AI, humbled by our responsibility to be ethical participants.

**Positioning:** "The Humankind of AI" - We help leaders solve business problems WITH AI (not AI replacing people).

**Target Audience:** Innovative business leaders who:
- Lead organizations considering or implementing AI
- Need to translate AI capabilities into business value
- Face practical challenges in AI adoption
- Value frameworks and mental models
- Want practitioner insights, not vendor pitches

---

## THE CORE WRITING FORMULA

**Story → Insight → Framework → Application → Invitation**

Every article should follow this progression:
1. **Story**: Personal anecdote or concrete scenario that illustrates the challenge
2. **Insight**: The non-obvious truth about the situation
3. **Framework**: A mental model or structured approach to understand the problem
4. **Application**: Practical steps the reader can take
5. **Invitation**: Soft call-to-action that respects the reader's autonomy

---

## OPENING HOOK STRATEGIES

Choose ONE of these three proven approaches:

### **Strategy 1: Personal Anecdote (Most Effective)**
Start with a specific, detailed story from your experience:
- "Years ago, when I was [specific situation]..."
- Include sensory details and specific names/places
- Transition to broader insight: "This experience taught me..."
- **Length**: 2-3 paragraphs (70-120 words)

**Example Pattern:**
> "Years ago, I worked on a project for Michigan's Health and Human Services department. We were tasked with [specific details]. What struck me most was [insight]. This experience shaped how I think about [topic]."

### **Strategy 2: Contrarian Observation**
Challenge conventional wisdom:
- "Contrary to popular perception..."
- "Most leaders believe X, but..."
- "The conventional approach to Y misses..."
- Follow with evidence and deeper analysis

### **Strategy 3: Universal Experience**
Start with something the reader recognizes:
- "Every morning, business leaders wake up to..."
- "Many executives I meet share a common challenge..."
- Create immediate identification, then pivot to insight

---

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

## VOCABULARY & TONE BALANCE

### **Tonal Distribution:**
- **40% Authority**: Frameworks, research, proven approaches
- **30% Empathy**: Understanding challenges, acknowledging difficulty
- **20% Pragmatism**: Actionable steps, practical advice
- **10% Urgency**: Competitive pressure, market evolution

### **Authority Words & Phrases:**
- "In my experience..."
- "I've seen this pattern..."
- "Research shows..."
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "Our work with [specific client/industry]..."
- "Framework," "mental model," "approach," "methodology"

### **Empathy Words & Phrases:**

- "Many leaders struggle with..."
- "This is harder than it looks..."
- "I don't claim to have all the answers..."
- "It's tempting to believe..."
- "The challenge isn't..."

### **Urgency Words & Phrases:**
- "Organizations that wait..."
- "The window for..."
- "Competitive advantage..."
- "Market evolution demands..."
- "Those who act now..."

### **Technical vs. Accessible Balance:**
- **Always define technical terms** on first use
- **Use analogies** to explain complex concepts
- **Prefer concrete over abstract**: "Your customer service team" over "stakeholders"
- **Include specific numbers**: "33,800 bridge crossings" not "many crossings"
- **Name real technologies**: "LLMs," "computer vision," "MLOps" (but explain them)

---

## SIGNATURE WRITING TECHNIQUES

### **1. The "Yes, But..." Pivot**
Acknowledge conventional wisdom, then reveal deeper truth:

**Pattern:**
> "Yes, [common belief/approach]. But [deeper insight that challenges or refines it]."

**Example:**
> "Yes, AI can automate processes. But the real transformation happens when teams reimagine entire workflows around human-AI collaboration."

### **2. Contrasting Pairs**
Use memorable contrasts to crystallize insights:
- "90% People, 10% Technology"
- "Convenience Over Perfection"
- "From isolation to access"
- "From disconnected data to intelligent automation"

### **3. Personal Validation**
Establish authority through specific experience:
- "I've seen this happen so many times I've lost count..."
- "In project after project..."
- "Across dozens of implementations..."

### **4. Metaphorical Language**
Make abstract concepts tangible:
- "AI failures look like silence"
- "The cold start problem"
- "Bridge the gap"
- "Navigate the complexity"

**Note:** Use metaphors sparingly and avoid clichés.

### **5. Strategic Questions**
Engage readers with rhetorical questions that preview your answer:
- "So what should leaders do?"
- "Why does this matter?"
- "What's the alternative?"

Follow immediately with your answer.

### **6. One-Word Conclusions**
After complex explanation, deliver simple truth:
> [Long, nuanced explanation]... Simple.
> [Detailed analysis]... That's it.

---

## INTEGRATING EXAMPLES & CASE STUDIES

### **How to Introduce Examples:**

**Pattern 1: Brief Reference**
> "In a recent project with Michigan HHS, we discovered..."

**Pattern 2: Detailed Narrative**
> "Consider what happened at [Client/Industry]. They faced [specific challenge]. Traditional approaches suggested [X], but [what actually worked]."

**Pattern 3: Aggregate Insight**
> "Across multiple implementations, a pattern emerges: [insight]."

### **Rules for Examples:**
- **Be specific**: Names, numbers, industries, outcomes
- **Show causation**: "When X happened, Y resulted because Z"
- **Connect to principle**: "This illustrates [broader truth]"
- **Use real projects** when possible (Michigan HHS, bridge counting in Rwanda, Mexico banking)
- **Anonymize sensitively**: "A financial services client" is fine if needed
- **Always include outcomes**: Don't just describe problems, show results

---

## TRANSITION TECHNIQUES

### **Between Sections:**
- "Here's what this means for leaders..."
- "Let's examine why this matters..."
- "Consider the implications..."
- "This brings us to the central question..."

### **Between Ideas:**
- "But there's more to it..."
- "Beyond this..."
- "The deeper truth is..."
- "What's really happening here?"

### **From Problem to Solution:**
- "So how do we address this?"
- "The path forward requires..."
- "Here's the approach that works..."

### **Building on Previous Points:**
- "This connects to..."
- "Building on this foundation..."
- "Taking this further..."

---

## CLOSING STRATEGIES

### **Type 1: The Invitation (Most Common)**
Soft call-to-action that offers value without pressure:

**Pattern:**
> "If [this situation resonates], I'd welcome [low-commitment action]. [Optional: What you offer]."

**Example:**
> "If you're navigating these challenges, I'd welcome a conversation about how other leaders have approached them. Sometimes the most valuable insight comes from comparing notes with someone who's been there."

### **Type 2: The Future Vision**
End by pointing forward:

**Pattern:**
> "The organizations that [action] will [outcome]. The question isn't whether [change], but how prepared you'll be when it does."

### **Type 3: The Return to Story**
Circle back to opening anecdote with new meaning:

**Pattern:**
> "Remember [reference to opening]? Today, [how things have evolved]. That's the opportunity before us."

### **Type 4: The Practical Takeaway**
Leave readers with immediate action:

**Pattern:**
> "Start here: [1-3 specific, actionable steps]. You don't need [big thing], you need [small thing that leads to big thing]."

## UNIQUE STYLISTIC ELEMENTS

### **1. Vulnerability + Confidence**
Balance authoritative knowledge with intellectual humility:
- "I don't have all the answers, but here's what I've learned..."
- "This is harder than it looks..."
- "The honest answer is: it depends..."

### **2. The Aside**
Use parentheticals to add depth without derailing:
- "(and this is critical)..."
- "(more on this later)..."
- "(though I'm simplifying here)..."

### **3. Lists with Context**
Don't just list items—add brief explanatory clauses:
- "Data strategy (not just data collection)"
- "Change management (the human side of technology)"
- "Iterative deployment (because big bangs fail)"

### **4. Qualifying Statements**
Show nuanced thinking:
- "In most cases..."
- "Generally speaking..."
- "With some exceptions..."
- "Depending on context..."

### **5. Direct Address**
Speak directly to the reader occasionally:
- "If you're a business leader considering AI..."
- "You might be wondering..."
- "Your experience probably mirrors..."
